Dedekind Number Calculation using Random Walks

Overview

This program calculates the 10th Dedekind number using random walks. Dedekind numbers are a sequence of numbers that arise in combinatorial mathematics, specifically in the study of lattice theory. The Dedekind number M(10) is the number of antichains in a lattice of all subsets of a 10-element set.

In this implementation, we utilize random walks to approach the problem, relying on the Monte Carlo method to estimate the value.

Dedekind Numbers
The Dedekind number M(n) is defined as the number of antichains in the power set of a set of size n. The Dedekind numbers grow extremely fast as n increases, and they are known for their large computational complexity when calculating for larger values of n.
